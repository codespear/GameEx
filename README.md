GameEx
======

A few classes built to use SDL, OpenGL and the latest C++ language features to write a small game or two.  The design principles are to keep a few subsystems that can be combined and extended when implementing a game.  The functionality provided by the 'game' subsystem allows you to create a hierarchy of game objects.
