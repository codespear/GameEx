# Shooter
## Game Design
Shooter is a *vertical shoot'em up*.


## Shortcomings
*Resolution*
Currently to 800 x 600.  Supporting multiple graphics modes
with the fixed tileset seems a bit tricky.  Switching to full screen can  be done
but your OS must be setup to "cut off" the sides of the display, otherwise round 
things look oval.  Do do this run "shooter.exe -fullscreen".
